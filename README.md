## 📖 Overview
**CampusLoop** is a hyper-local marketplace designed to solve the problem of resource wastage on university campuses. It allows students to buy, sell, rent, or donate academic essentials (textbooks, lab coats, drafters, electronics) within a trusted network.

Unlike generic platforms (OLX, Facebook), CampusLoop focuses on:
* **Verification:** Users must be verified students.
* **Sustainability:** A "Green Credits" gamification system rewards eco-friendly actions.
* **Trust:** QR Code-based physical hand-offs to prevent scams.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🛒 Buy, Sell & Rent:** Categorized listings for academic and dorm essentials.
* **💬 Real-time Chat:** Integrated messaging to negotiate prices and meetup spots.
* **🌱 Green Credits:** Earn points for donating or recycling items; viewable on a Leaderboard.
* **🔐 Secure Handoff:** Generate and scan QR codes to confirm transaction completion.
* **🔍 Lost & Found:** A dedicated section to report and find lost campus items.
